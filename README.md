# 3D Scene Rendering - Textured Sphere

Triangular mesh of a sphere, done from scratch, displayed using Perspective Projection. Linear interpolation of vertex projection has been implemented, for correct texture appearance. Program uses only single-pixel operation algorithms, implemented by me for one of my other projects, and reused here (Bresenham's line drawing algorithm, and Polygon Fill using Active Edge Table)
